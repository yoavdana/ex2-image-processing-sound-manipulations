in this project there are 3 main subjects:
• Implementing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on 1D and 2D signals
• Performing sound fast forward,by 4 different methods,starting from primitive to complicated.
  the first is a simple change in the sapmpling rate of the files,it creates pitch shifting.
  the second is by a simple fourier spectrom resizing,it creates pitch shifting .
  third is spectrogram resizing,this method dont creat pitch shifting,but the new time signal is distorted by umatching phase.
  the last method is spectrogram and phase vecoder,has no pitch shifting and the phases are matched.
• Performing image derivative
