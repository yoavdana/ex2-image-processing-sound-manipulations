It can be seen that in the Fourier derivation we also get rings on the image, this is because multipling the Fourier transform in the time domain
Give a frequency convolution, this means that a rectangle will become a sinc in the image area and hence the shape of the rings.
In addition, the calculations are not performed with perfect accuracy, so with each deviation in the calculation in the frequency range,
 we get a more significant deviation in the time domain
(Principle of uncertainty), this is because a small error in frequency will provide us with a wide error in time (inverse fertility ratio between time and frequency).
