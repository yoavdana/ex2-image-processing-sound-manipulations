You can clearly hear that the frequencies in both ways have not changed relative to the original signal, albeit when decreasing the
The spectrogram only, without coordinating the phases of the sound obtained is not clean and very different from the original sound (gets a hoarse and muffled sound),
the reason is that when reconstracting the signal from the spectrogram after resizing ,the waves are out of phase and can cancel eachother'do to that we can loose information
Verify when using phase vecoder this problem is solved.This is because when the spectrogram is reconnected to a new signal,
Phases are coordinated in a corresponding ratio along the new signal, this shift allows the signal to be constructed in a way more similar to the original.
